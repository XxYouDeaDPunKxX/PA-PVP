# PA_PVP - a PLUTONIUM-like Adversarial Peer Validation Protocol

![PA_PVP Banner](docs/banner.png)

You don't need to feel ready.

Doubt is enough to move forward.

In this system, uncertainty does not slow you down.
It generates the next action.

**Doubt is not a blocker.  
It is a state transition.**

Paste your current state.  
Get one verdict. One next action.  
Run the loop.

---

## Decisions that converge

You don't make a perfect choice once.
You run a system that:
- keeps what survives reality
- discards what doesn't
- unlocks what's next

Every iteration must reduce uncertainty or change the state of the world.
If it doesn't, it's invalid.

Work stops being a list.
It becomes a trajectory with memory.

---

## Reality is inside the loop (autonomy + human sensor)

Autonomous by default (`ask_user=NONE`).
If you enable `ask_user=ALLOW`, it may ask **one** minimal real-world input when mechanically justified.

When internal evidence is not enough, it does not simulate certainty:
- it **parks cleanly**
- and (if enabled) asks for **one** minimal real-world probe
- you return with evidence
- the loop continues stronger

You are not "just copy/paste".
You are the sensor that connects the runtime to the world.

## Auto-learning (mechanical, not narrative)

PA_PVP is designed to learn deterministically across iterations:
- probes are adversarial-by-construction (try to falsify the critical driver)
- near-miss loops trigger redesign (no infinite "almost passed")
- spent cycles are tracked (`pc/nm/inc`) so the system knows when simulation is exhausted
- debt forces resolution instead of postponement
- circular dependencies (`depends_on` cycles) are treated as structural modeling errors and force redesign

A failed attempt is not a note.
It becomes a constraint.

## Quickstart (copy/paste)

1) Load the canonical kernel: [PA_PVP_full_v9.7_canonical.txt](PA_PVP_full_v9.7_canonical.txt)
2) Paste a batch with wrappers, run it, then paste the full output back (snapshot-as-input is supported).

```text
<<<B expire_days=30 ask_user=NONE exec_capability=NO_RUNTIME close_policy=SIM_OK ssot_scale=MIN resource_pool=>>>

<<<I id=E1 title="Short title" expire_days=60 ask_user=INHERIT uses= reversibility=>>>
<<<PLAN>>>

<<<END>>>

<summary><strong>Technical contract (SSOT-grade, deterministic)</strong></summary>

### What it returns (invariants)
Every valid run produces:
- a forced verdict: `DO NOW` / `DO LATER` / `DISCARD`
- deterministic machine state (batch-safe)
- one executable `[NEXT]` action (or none if terminal)
- max five atomic steps

No discussions. No "it depends" as output.
We call it the "kernel" because of its internal structure: this choice is intentional to reduce drift and noise: one deterministic SSOT core enforces invariants and produces the state transition, while everything else (Quickstart, REPORT, orchestration policy) stays a consumer layer that must not change SSOT semantics.

### Output structure (stable)
- Kernel decision runs: exactly ONE code block.
- Inside the code block: `[USER_PANEL]`, `[PANEL]`, `[QUEUE]`, then `[ITEM id=...]` blocks.
- After the code block:
  - mandatory `[HUMAN_TABLE]` (derived-only from `[QUEUE]`)
  - optional `[HUMAN_TABLE_OPS]` (derived-only ops console)
  
Consumer commands:
- `REPORT` / `REPORT LITE` are derived-only human render passes and MUST NOT output any code blocks (see [`docs/guide.md`](docs/guide.md)).

### Knobs (batch-level)
- `exec_capability=NO_RUNTIME|RUNTIME_OK` (default `NO_RUNTIME`)
- `close_policy=SIM_OK|REAL_ONLY` (default `SIM_OK`)
- `ssot_scale=MIN|DEBUG` (default `MIN`, auto-escalates per item when contested/gated)
- `ask_user=NONE|ALLOW` (default `NONE`)

### DIY/LOW scalability (MIN_SURFACE)
If `profile=DIY` or `impact=LOW` and the item is not entering `PROBING`, the item output must stay minimal:
`[ITEM_PANEL]` + `[DERIVED]` + `[STEPS]` + `[NEXT]` (no probe bureaucracy unless actually `PROBING`).

### AskUser (external evidence mode)
See: [docs/guide.md#askuser-always-none-until-you-need-it](docs/guide.md#askuser-always-none-until-you-need-it)

### Operational UI
- `[QUEUE]` / `[HUMAN_TABLE]` include `gate:` (dominant cause token).
- `[USER_PANEL]` includes `TopGates:` (up to 5 systemic blockers).
- Optional: `[RISK_DASHBOARD]` aggregates fragile drivers across the batch (derived-only).
- Peer convergence (A/B, consumer-level): [docs/guide.md#peer-convergence-a-b-consumer-level](docs/guide.md#peer-convergence-a-b-consumer-level)
