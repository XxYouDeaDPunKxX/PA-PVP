# PA_PVP - a PLUTONIUM-like Adversarial Peer Validation Protocol
Close decisions. Do not debate forever.

PA_PVP is an **AI-native decision kernel** with a **human-readable interface**.
It turns a plan into:
- adversarial critique
- a forced verdict (**DO NOW / DO LATER / DISCARD**)
- a short list of executable steps ordered by cost/benefit
